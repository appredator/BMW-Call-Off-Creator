# BMW-Call-Off-Creator
C# App that creates a file based on variable inputs in a format defined by BMW for 5300 call-off files. 
The inputs are validated using Reg Expressions. 

I created this a solution on BMW implementations when a manufacturing program was in the early stages and BMW could not give the Insequence Host call off files yet. 
This app allowed me to test the Insequence system with accurate call off files instead of waiting on BMW.
